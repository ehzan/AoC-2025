## Advent of Code 2025 🎄

This repository contains my solutions to the puzzles of [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025). All solutions are implemented
in Python.

### Usage

To execute the programs, follow these steps:

1. Place the input data for each day in the corresponding directory:
   <br>`./input/day{n}.txt`
2. Run the Python scripts to obtain the solutions:
  <br>`python3 day{n}.py`

\* *Day 10 requires the PuLP package. Install it with: `pip install pulp`*

<br>Feel free to explore and use these solutions as a reference or inspiration for your own Advent of Code journey!
